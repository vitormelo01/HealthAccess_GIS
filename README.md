# Do Certificate-of-Need Laws Increase Rural Access? A GIS-Based Estimate

### Background:

Certificate-of-need (CON) laws impose bureaucratic costs to healthcare providers in 35 American states. These regulations require healthcare providers planning on opening a new healthcare facility, expanding a current facility, or purchasing medical equipment to first show to a regulatory body that their region needs the service. 

### Objective:

This project estimates the impact of CON laws on the average distance between citizens living in rural areas and the closest hospital.

### Methods:

Average driving distances between rural citizens and the nearest hospital are measured using GIS spatial analysis. We then apply a synthetic control analysis the estimate the impact of revoking CON laws in Pennsylvania in 1996.  

### Software Utilized:

Stata and ArcGIS.

### Results:

N/A

### Conclusion:
